# GlobalGiving Data Challenge

<strong>Task</strong><br>
Nonprofits come to GlobalGiving for many reasons, but what makes them stick around? Our program team is interested in better understanding the retention of nonprofit partners on the platform so they can better design programs to support longer-term relationships. Using the data provided, please put together a short analysis that answers the following questions:
* What metrics might we use to describe organization retention based on this data?
* How might you summarize this data such that a non-technical user could track
changes on a monthly basis? These should be static proof-of-concept examples of the kinds of things that could be included in an interactive dashboard or an automatic email report, but should not be interactive or automated for this assignment.
